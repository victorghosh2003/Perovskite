# Perovskite
Hello! The source code provided will have the reasoning behind why I did what I did in each line.
To be brief, the computational significance test is called a shuffling significance tests where we assume two groups to be equally likely, we switch their "labels", plot their mean differences and simulate this thousands of times. We find the percentage of points above the original mean difference and that is our P-value. This is helpful due to the fact that it allows us to simulate across a variety of different hydroiodides without having to repeat the calculations over and over again.



Also attached is a sample of my Machine Learning algorithim which takes a set of 3-dimensional values and finds a mathematical function (a plane) to separate the 3-d space in order for us to predict which values would lead us to a high quality crystal.
